**About Me**

My name is Bryce Pinsel, and I am a Freshman here at the University of Missouri. I am a business marketing major and I am planning to have a minor in information tecnology, which is why I am taking this class. I'm from Libertyville, Illionois which is suburb north of Chicago. Some of the reasons why I came to Mizzou is because it's a beautiful school with a great business program and very affordable. Information Tecnology can be very confusing but I find it to be very interesting and I think it will be something that can help me in the future, especially with getting a job.

* Size of the campus
* Large student population
* Football Games
* Beautiful campus
* Great programs
* Greek life

Mizzou a great school, and I am very happy to be here. I have no regrets coming here, the enviornment has been great and I have enjoyed every minute of it. It stinks that we had to leave early because of the caronavirus, but overall freshman year was amazing. I joined greek life my second semester and that has helped me with making a lot of friends. I can't wait for three more years at this amazing school.
