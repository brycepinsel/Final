**About Me**

<p>My name is Bryce Pinsel, and I am a Freshman here at the University of Missouri. I am a business marketing major and I am planning to have a minor in information tecnology, which is why I am taking this class. I'm from Libertyville, Illionois which is suburb north of Chicago. Some of the reasons why I came to Mizzou is because it's a beautiful school with a great business program and very affordable. Information Tecnology can be very confusing but I find it to be very interesting and I think it will be something that can help me in the future, especially with getting a job.</p>
